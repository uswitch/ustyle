These guidelines are here to help you chose images that reflect our brand values and personality. If you&#x2019;re questioning whether an image is suitable, ask a designer &#x2013; they&#x2019;ll be happy to help.</p>\n\n  <h3>Principles</h3>\n\n  <h4>Focused</h4>\n  <p>Images are more interesting when they have a point of focus.</p>\n\n  <h4>Contextual</h4>\n  <p>People and objects should be properly contextualised. Avoid cropping an image so severely that it&#x2019;s setting is lost.</p>\n\n  <h4>Local</h4>\n  <p>Make sure clothing, architectural features, light and style have a UK feel.</p>\n\n  <h3>Mood</h3>\n  <p>Relatable, genuine, optimistic, affirmative.</p>\n\n  <h4>Colour</h4>\n  <p>Our preference is for natural light where possible. Colours should be warm, vibrant and saturated where possible &#x2013; avoid images that are &#x201C;washed out&#x201D;. Do not use dramatic filters, colourisation effects, or black and white.</p>\n\n  <h4>People and lifestyle</h4>\n  <p>Lifestyle shots should be reportage in style, documenting people in their day-to-day lives. Subjects should be unposed, and within their natural environment. People should never be cut out or appear over solid backgrounds. Images should be relatable and feature real, everyday people. Avoid fake or forced emotions as it can seem ingenuine. A range of gender, race, and age should be represented.</p>\n\n  <h4>Products and objects</h4>\n  <p>Object focused imagery may be cut out and appear over our brand colours or on white. When cut out, the whole object must be appear &#x2013; edges must never be cut off.</p>\n\n  <p>When objects aren&#x2019;t cut out, they should be realistic in their setting and not appear staged. Images should be straightforward, not overly metaphor based, and should not appear noticeably manipulated.</p>\n\n  <h4>Illustrations</h4>\n  <p>Illustrations may be used to add understanding and delight to an experience.</p>\n\n  <p>Our illustrative style is simple and geometric. Our brand colours should be used predominantly, although variations in shades and saturation may be necessarily. Illustrations should generally appear over solid colour or white backgrounds. Avoid using illustrations that are clich&#xE9;d or overly metaphor based.</p>\n\n  <h4>Generating new photography</h4>\n  <p>We generally try to avoid commissioning photography unless completely necessary as it can prove to be extremely expensive. Before commissioning new photography, carefully consider:</p>\n\n  <ol>\n  <li>Do we already have what&#x2019;s needed in our image library?</li>\n  <li>If not, can you find it &#x2013; in stock, from a press office or other legitimate source?</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>Where we do shoot our own (product shots, staff portraits etc being examples of where this may be necessary) we follow these guidelines.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"cropping\">\n  <h2>Cropping</h2>\n  <p>Images will often need to be cropped to fit various size requirements. When cropped, images should still follow all guidelines.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"where-to-get-images\">\n  <h2>Where to get images</h2>\n  <p>The following sites are our preferred resources as images are royalty-free, reasonably priced, and generally good quality. There are shared uSwitch logins for these sites &#x2013; get in touch with the Service Desk if you don&apos;t have access.</p>\n\n  <ol>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\">www.shutterstock.com</a></li>\n  <p>Monthly subscription which allows us to download 750 images per month</p>\n\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.istock.com\">www.istock.com</a></li>\n  <p>Monthly subscription which allows us to download 10 signature images per month</p>\n\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.500px.com\">www.500px.com</a></li>\n  <p>Images are purchased individually.</p>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"what-to-purchase\">\n  <h2>What to purchase</h2>\n  <h3>Dimensions</h3>\n  <p>Stock sites often allow you to purchase images in Small, Medium and Large sizes. Purchasing the largest option is recommended as this will cover most of our online use cases and allow for flexibility when it comes to cropping.</p>\n\n  <h3>File types</h3>\n  <h4>Photography</h4>\n  <p>Most photography that you purchase from stock sites will be either JPG or TIFF format. Either is fine, but if it&#x2019;s a TIFF, it will need to be converted to a JPG before using online.</p>\n\n  <h4>Graphics and Illustrations</h4>\n  <p>Graphics and illustrations are usually available in EPS, SVG, or PNG format. When available, EPS or SVG files are preferred as they can be scaled to any size. EPS files will need to be converted to an SVG or PNG before using online.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"types-of-licenses\">\n  <h2>Types of licenses</h2>\n\n  <h3>1. Rights-managed</h3>\n  <p>Rights-managed images often have limitations in regards to the following:</p>\n\n  <ul>\n  <li>How many times you can use them</li>\n  <li>Regions you can use them in</li>\n  <li>Type of media you can use them on</li>\n  <li>Length of time you can use them for</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>2. Royalty-free</h3>\n  <p>Royalty-free images can generally be used on multiple projects for an unlimited amount of time. They should not be confused with &#x201C;free&#x201D;. You must still pay a one-off cost to use them.</p>\n\n  <p>We prefer royalty-free images as there&#x2019;s fewer restrictions around using them. However even with this type of licence, there may be some usage restrictions, so it&#x2019;s important to read the licence agreements and act accordingly.</p>\n\n  <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/license\">Shutterstock licensing</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.istockphoto.com/legal/license-agreement\">iStock licensing</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://static.500px.net/docs/commercial_licensing_agreement.pdf\">500px licensing</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>3. Creative Commons</h3>\n  <p>Creative Commons means the owner of an image has made it available for use under certain restrictions. Restrictions often include that you must attribute the image to the owner, that you may not use it for commercial purposes, or that you may not alter the image.</p>\n\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com\">Flickr</a> is a good resource for images that have been made available through Creative Commons, but make sure you understand and comply with any restrictions they&#x2019;re being offered under.</p>\n\n  <h3>4. Public Domain</h3>\n  <p>Public Domain refers to images that do not have a copyright and therefore free for anyone to use. It can apply to images that are very old or where the creator has given up their copyright.</p>\n\n  <h3>How do you know if you can use an image?</h3>\n  <h4>Only use an image if:</h4>\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n   <li>You&#x2019;ve purchased it</li>\n   <li>You&#x2019;ve taken it yourself or hired a photographer to take it for you</li>\n   <li>You have written permission from the owner of the image</li>\n   <li>It&#x2019;s Creative Commons and you&#x2019;ve complied with any usage conditions</li>\n   <li>It&#x2019;s Public Domain</li>\n  </ol>\n\n <h4>Never take images directly from:</h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Search engines (Google images etc.)</li>\n   <li>Other people&#x2019;s or organisation&#x2019;s social media (embedding a tweet is ok if you ask the owner&#x2019;s permission)</li>\n   <li>News outlets</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>Keep in mind that manipulating an image that isn&#x2019;t yours (adding a filter, cropping etc) doesn&#x2019;t give you the right to use it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"image-storage\">\n  <h2>Image Storage</h2>\n  <h3>Where to store images</h3>\n  <p>Purchased images should be added to our shared Google Drive storage within the appropriate category. <strong>This should be the original, full-sized, uncropped and uncompressed image only.</strong> This allows for cross vertical sharing as well as usage in other mediums such as email.</p>\n\n  <p>While the shared library exists so images can be reused, try not to overuse images to the point that they lose their impact.</p>\n\n  <h3>What to name images</h3>\n  <p>Images should be named with a few descriptive words, with words separated by hyphens. Images that are an illustration should have the prefix of &quot;illustation-&quot;.</p>\n\n  <p>For mobile phones, image names should be formatted as follows:</p>\n  <p><strong>yyyy-mm-dd-manufacturer-phonename-phoneversion.png</strong></p>\n  <p>For example:<strong> 2015-04-10-samsung-galaxy-s6.png</strong></p>\n  <p>The date refers to the <u>date of the phone release.</u></p>\n\n  <h3>Tagging images</h3>\n  <p>For searchability, it&apos;s important to include descriptive tags for each image you add to Google Drive. You can do this under the &quot;Description&quot; field. The first two tags should be the stock site you got the image from, as well as the image number. Include any other tags that might be useful, separating each tag with commas. </p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"about-retina\">\n  <h2>About Retina</h2>\n  <p><strong>Retina display</strong> refers to monitors and devices that have a very high pixel density, making screen content appear very crisp and sharp.</p>\n\n  <p>To take advantage of these high-quality displays, we must use <strong>Retina images</strong>. That simply means that we need to double the intended size of our images. </p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"us-content-group\" id=\"our-image-sizes\">\n  <h2>Our image sizes</h2>\n  <p>Below are the minimum required sizes for our images in various materials.

It tells us that it looks like there is a problem, but now what the problem is. Data comes from:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>GA</li>\n      <li>Fullstory</li>\n      <li>Crazyegg</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Similarly business objectives are things we desire to happen. They tell us what we want to the outcome to be. Objectives sound like:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Increase conversion by&#x2026;</li>\n      <li>Reduce drop out by&#x2026;</li>\n      <li>Stop people bouncing on&#x2026;</li>\n      <li>Stop people clicking out on&#x2026;</li>\n      <li>Get people to click on&#x2026;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>These tell us there is a problem, but we don&#x2019;t know what it is.</p>\n    <p>A real problems is something we&#x2019;ve observed a significant number of occasions.</p>\n\n    <h3>How to define the problem</h3>\n    <p>Testing designed to steer design, or validate assumptions about what problems users are encountering, is known as &#x2018;formative&#x2019; testing. It&#x2019;s open-ended, and the tasks are simply to run a comparison, or to go through a journey start to finish.</p>\n    <p>Any type of testing, whether it be face-to-face, guerilla, remote, or interviews, can help define the problem. This allows us to frame the problem with a problem statement. A problem statement is:</p>\n    <blockquote>A concise description of the issues that need to be addressed - it is specific, measurable and explains what it impacts. There are no assumptions or solutions.</blockquote>\n\n    <h3>Only with a problem can you design a solution</h3>\n    <p>Once the problem is clearly defined, start trying to solve it (one problem at a time), but remember to validate the solutions as soon as possible.</p>\n    <p>&apos;Summative&apos; usability testing can help validate. Summative testing gives the user a particular task to complete that tests the solution against the problem. Again, any type of testing can perform this function.</p>\n\n    <h3>But wait!</h3>\n    <p>User testing is great to validate flows, designs and interactions, but it&apos;s not exhaustive. There might be bugs, or solutions that don&apos;t work in certain scenarios. This is where in-house testing and the device lab comes in.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<!-- Testing -->\n\n<a id=\"testing\"></a>\n<div class=\"us-content-group\">\n  <h2>How to test</h2>\n  <p>So what type of testing should we use, and when?</p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/\">This article by Nielsen Norman Group</a> is a great starting point to understand testing methods and when to apply each.<p></p> \n  <p>There are over 20 types of validation, including quant methods, but here at uSwitch we predominantly use the following:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#interviews\">Interviews</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#face-to-face\">Face-to-face usability testing</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#guerilla-testing\">Guerilla testing</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#in-house-testing\">In-house testing</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <a id=\"interviews\"></a>\n  <h3>Interviews</h3>\n  <p>Interviews are designed to understand behaviours, needs and pain-points around a particular task.</p> \n  <p>They are open-ended and can help define design personas - archetypes that can be used as a reference point for any design changes for that product.</p>  \n  <h4>How</h4>\n  <p>See the interview checklist</p>\n  <h4>When</h4>\n  <p>Interviews are most commonly used at the earliest stage of product development to determine the needs/problems that the product will address.</p>  \n\n  <a id=\"face-to-face\"></a>\n  <h3>Face-to-face usability testing</h3>\n  <p>Face-to-face testing can be used in a formative or summative sense, and can be combined with an interview and simple exercises, like card sorting.</p>\n  <p>This is the highest-fidelity form of validation. The feedback you receive   will be of the highest quality, but it will also take you the most time.</p> \n  \n  <h4>How</h4>\n  <p>Face-to-face testing consists of preparing a particular task, putting it in front of real users, and seeing how they get on.</p> \n  <p>As it&#x2019;s face-to-face, you can also interview users in this format, or ask them to complete exercises such as:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Product Reaction Cards - Used to determine how desirable a product or process is</li>\n    <li>Unmarked Semantic Differential Scales - Used to understand reactions to particular words and phrases</li>\n    <li>Card sorting - Used to understand hierarchy of importance, or expected flows</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>See the testing checklist for a step-by-step guide to setting up and running a test. The most crucial components are:</p>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Goals - What are you trying to achieve?</li>\n  <li>Tasks - Every task you ask a user to complete should answer a question you need answered. Formative testing on an exisiting product will have open-ended goals, whereas tasks designed to test a solution should be specific.</li>\n  <li>Test plan - Script, scenario, tasks, participants, questions, anything the moderators needs. Write it all down so you have it to hand during the test.</li> \n  <li>Test the test - Something will go wrong, promise, so test it first.</li>\n  <li>Get your team involved - There&apos;s nothing like seeing your solution fail first hand.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h4>When</h4>\n  <p>Anytime. For an existing product where the objective is to discover problems, an open-ended test asking users to complete the most common journey. This should be done at least once a year.</p>\n  <p>For a new product or feature face-to-face testing is always a good idea. The objective here is to <strong>test the solution against the problem</strong> using particular tasks.</p> \n\n  <a id=\"guerilla-testing\"></a>\n  <h3>Guerilla testing</h3>    \n  <p>A lower-fidelity version of face-to-face testing, guerilla testing sacrifices quality for speed. The feedback you receive will be of lower quality as the participants may not fit user types, and the testing environment is more &#x2018;ad-hoc&#x2019; (think coffee shops, sandwich places).</p>\n  <p>Just like face-to-face testing, guerilla testing involves preparing a particular task, putting it in front of real users, and seeing how they get on. You can also do interviews and get quant feedback but again, the feedback will be lower quality.</p> \n  <h4>How</h4>\n  <p>See the guerilla testing checklist for a step-by-step guide to setting up and running a test.</p>\n  <p>The number of participants should be at least 5 for guerilla testing, but you can use your discretion.</p> \n  <h4>When</h4>\n  <p>Guerilla testing is perfect at the early stage of a design, when you want to sense check a particular flow, component, or wording.</p> \n  <p>Any fidelity of design can be used. Guerilla testing works best when kept relatively informal, and the participant feels at ease.</p>\n  \n  <a id=\"in-house-testing\"></a>\n  <h3>In-house testing</h3>\n  <p>Asking your colleagues in the office for feedback. This is the quickest but lowest quality form of validation.</p>  \n  <p>Like guerilla testing this is an informal type of testing, but the quality is considerably lower owing to familiarity with the product, bias based on personal relationships and a mismatch between persona types and testers.</p> \n  <p>In-house testing is perfect for bug testing, seeing if anyone can &#x2018;break&#x2019; your design, and last-minute tweaks. It is not for designed to surface flow or interaction changes.</p> \n  <h4>How</h4>\n  <p>See the bug-testing checklist</p>\n  <h4>When</h4>\n  <p>A few days before release</p>   \n  \n</div>","subNav":[{"name":"When don't we need user validation?","link":"#no-validation"},{"name":"When do we need user validation?","link":"#validation"},{"name":"How to test","link":"#testing"}]},{"name":"Typography","page":"typography.html","template":"styleguide/templates/styleguide.tpl","section":"pattern-library","blocks":[{"page":"Pattern Library/Typography","name":"Headings","description":"<p>   The default heading styling across all uSwitch pages.</p>\n<p>   We allow extending the sizes of these headings with <code>%heading-{$i}</code> so that we don&#39;t repeat similar font sizes across the site.</p>\n","markup":{"example":"  <h1>Heading 1</h1>\n  <h2>Heading 2</h2>\n  <h3>Heading 3</h3>\n  <h4>Heading 4</h4>\n  <h5>Heading 5</h5>\n  <h6>Heading 6</h6>","escaped":"  &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;Heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;h4&gt;Heading 4&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;h5&gt;Heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;\n  &lt;h6&gt;Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;"},"path":"vendor/assets/stylesheets/ustyle/basics/_typography.scss","file":"_typography.scss","link":"headings"},{"page":"Pattern Library/Typography","name":"Paragraphs","description":"<p>   Default paragraph styling with a margin bottom.</p>\n","state":[{"name":".us-standfirst","escaped":"us-standfirst","description":"Used for heros and introductory paragraphs.","markup":{"example":"   <p class=\"us-standfirst\">\n     Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
