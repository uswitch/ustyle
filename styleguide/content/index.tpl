      <h3>Design guidelines</h3>
      <p>uStyle includes documentation and guidelines relating to our core design principles. It is where we document everything that happens within our brand, UX and front-end development.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="us-col-md-6">
      <h3>Automated development</h3>
      <p>uStyle is a gem, a bower package, a npm package and static assets. This allows our team setup to choose how they wish to implement the core front-end of uSwitch. We've tried to be as accessible as possible.</p>

      <h3>Pattern library</h3>
      <p>At its core, uStyle is a pattern library. It contains all current components and elements of the uSwitch UI. These are documented in the <a href="/pattern-library/">pattern library</a> section.</p>

      <h3>Designer + developer happiness</h3>
      <p>Delivering designer + developer happiness is very important to us. uStyle provides a base for all our design and development work and allows our designers and developers to focus on the things that matter, whilst making their lives easier when prototyping.</p>
